# Development of a basic website 
#### Explanation of the task
We were asked to choose a character from the third age and build a website on it using basic HTML and CSS.

#### Why did I choose Tamara?
I chose to build the site on Tamara, my friend's grandmother.
Tamara is a role model for me, because she is a woman who has gone through difficult challenges in life and yet always embraces life, maintains optimism and joy.
I wish myself to have Tamara's happiness in life.
