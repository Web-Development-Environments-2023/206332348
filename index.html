<h2>About me</h2>
<div class="session">
  <p class="paragraph">
    Hello everyone, my name is Tamara and this is my personal blog.
    <br/> 
    I was born on February 5, 1943 in a frigid region of eastern Russia. My childhood was challenging, as I hardly had any memories of my father and was the youngest of five siblings.
    Being born during World War II meant that food was scarce, and my brother would collect pine cones from the forest to feed me pine nuts.
    <br/>
    When I turned 5, my family relocated to a different city. Though I attended school, I did not enjoy it, often skipping class to spend the day outside.
    I yearned to live in a warm place where winter was nonexistent as I despised the cold. After finishing 8th grade, I went on to study at a vocational school for 9th and 10th grade.
    Despite my desire to pursue nursing, my Jewish heritage prevented me from being accepted into a nursing school.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I joined the Air Force and served in the army as a flight controller and navigator. I found the position very fulfilling and was good at it.
    During my two and a half years in the army, I met my husband and had a child. Although I was encouraged to continue my military career, I chose to prioritize my family.
    After leaving the army, I held various high-level positions in the city.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In 1991, my first grandchild was born, and I began to hear about people leaving Russia and emigrating to Israel.
    We decided to follow suit after a few years, but it wasn't until my granddaughter was born that we made the final decision to move.
    Finally, my childhood dream of living in a warm country came true, and I am very happy to call Israel my home.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Today, at the age of 80, I work as a caregiver and am responsible for organizing events in the sheltered housing where I reside.
     I enjoy swimming, singing, and dancing, and I also help many of my fellow building residents who struggle with the language by accompanying them to places such as hospitals.
